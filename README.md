# IMOB301_Project

### IMOB/Mobile Development module (2023)
Worked as a group to develop an application using Java in Android Studio. It required us to code an application for a student portal system. This allowed the students, instructors and admins to sign in to the system and access different functionalities each with its own activity screen.
